                <p class="large_para">GetUp is an independent, grassroots community advocacy organisation which aims to build a more progressive Australia; an Australia that values environmental sustainability, economic fairness and social justice at its core.</p>
                <p class="regular_para">GetUp empowers Australians from all walks of life to get involved and change the news, not just watch from the sidelines. Whether it’s getting in contact with an MP, signing a petition, attending an event or helping to get a television ad on the air, GetUp members take targeted, coordinated and strategic action to get real results. At 30 June 2014, GetUp membership had swelled to over 800,000 Australians.</p>

                <p class="regular_para">Being an independent, not-for-profit organisation, GetUp does not accept donations from political parties or the Government, but instead relies on donations from its members to fund its work.</p>

                    <h3>Climate Action</h3>
                    <h4>Climate change consistently rates as the #1 issue for GetUp members.</h4>
                    <p>It is both urgent and important; a campaign we’ve been fighting to win for far too long considering we have such little time left in which to turn things around. This year the GetUp community not only helped deliver record numbers on the ground, we also started to pave the way for innovative tactics that have the potential to move millions of dollars out of climate destruction.</p>

                    <p>On November 17, a staggering 60,000 of us came together in 130 beautiful events across the country for GetUp’s National Day of Climate Action. We created news headlines across the country, with ABC, SBS, 9, 10, SKY, WIN, and 7 all covering the rallies. Our movement had in fact pulled off one of the largest rallies for climate action in Australia's history - earning the title of 'Abbott's Worst Enemy' for our work in climate activism.</p>

                    <p>The national rallies were attended by a broad cross-section of society: with religious figures, young activists and politicians standing shoulder to shoulder with firefighters and farmers. Supporters ranged from the very young to grandmothers and grandfathers in their nineties, rallying on behalf of future generations. Some of the most outstanding efforts were from GetUp members in regional areas, where hundreds of people gathered in small towns around the country.  Regional and country Australia's contribution was a tremendous part of what made the National Day of Climate Action so great. When our politicians turned on the evening news that day, one of the first things they heard was that GetUp members and residents in over 130 towns were demanding government do more to tackle climate change. And when politicians opened their newspapers the next day, they were forced to read the same. </p>

                    <p>Because of GetUp members in regional and country Australia, tens of thousands of Australians had the opportunity to participate locally in the National Day of Climate Action and contribute to such an important cause. Many of you told GetUp staff that although one person was registered as the organiser, there were lots of people and local organisations who passionately dedicated their time and energy to the organising effort.</p>

                    <p>All in all, the day garnered more than 140 media articles. Following the events, thousands of GetUp members contributed to fund the ongoing climate campaign. As the first significant mobilisation following the 2013 Election, GetUp members significantly changed the conversation about the Abbott Government’s climate policy and the public mood. </p>
                    
                    <p>The diverse crowd of the national day of action also helped spawn the launch of Australians for Action, a mini-site which represents the broad community of notable Australians urging our government to take greater, stronger, more ambitious actions on climate change. Ambassadors include some of Australia’s most well-known and respected figures: actors, performers, scientists, TV personalities, business professionals; as well as everyday folk. To date, more than 100,000 people have signed on! 

                    <p>These efforts also paved the way for further climate work, as we turned to focus the Great Barrier Reef, stop coal seam gas and help consumers move their money away from organisations that profit from climate destruction.</p>

                    <h5>People power evolves</h5>
                    <p>Since the Abbott Government came to power in September, the denial and disrespect of climate science has been in the spotlight. Their very first official act was to abolish the Climate Commission, the independent body which advised the Government on climate change; along with removing key ministerial positions on climate change and science and axing hundreds of jobs at the CSIRO. People power has never been more needed. 

                    <h5>Partnerships for change</h5>
                    <p>Throughout the year, GetUp members also participated in initiatives from across the environmental movement. In early 2014, GetUp teamed up wth 350.org to urge corporations to do better on climate. GetUp members who are also customers of UniSuper emailed the Board and the National Tertiary Education Union, calling on UniSuper to measure and disclose its fossil fuel exposure, reduce its fossil fuel exposure across all portfolios, and ultimately divest and go fossil free.

                    <p>In November 2013, 12,724 members made submissions to the Climate Change Authority – a whopping 99.9% of the total submissions. The resulting report called for an overhaul of expectations – including a 19% stronger emissions reduction target by 2020, and 40%-60% by 2030. 

                    <p>In January 2014, 14,585 members expressed their views on the Direct Action plan through a membership survey. The results of the survey shaped GetUp’s contribution to the Senate Inquiry on the Abbott Government's climate policies Direct Action plan.

                    <p>The following month, the Abbott government announced the panel to conduct the Renewable Energy Target (RET) Review. The review would be headed up by Dick Warburton, a self-confessed climate sceptic, and panellists with significant connections to mining and industry. This offered a key rapid response moment for members to stand up for our nation's renewable energy future. GetUp members were a part of raising serious questions about the Warburton review and its recommendations given Dick Warburton’s climate scepticism and industry connections. Thousands of GetUp members shared content on Facebook, highlighting the farcical appointments. 

                    <p>One day may this serve as an historical document, for our grandchildren to marvel at how hard we had to fight simply to evolve our way of doing business in order to protect the very planet that sustains us. Until then, we’ll keep working.

                <p>Over the past year, more and more Australians have come to CommunityRun to launch progressive campaigns around CSG, mining, environmental protection, health, refugee advocacy and local developments. CommunityRun campaigners are especially making ground at the local level, where they can wrangle the support of their community and personal networks and pressure a decision-maker to respond.</p> 

                <p>CommunityRun is defining itself in the online petition space as a campaigning platform not just a petition-creation tool, and CommunityRun campaigners are embracing both online and offline tactics to win their campaigns. Many CR campaigners compliment their online efforts by organising events in their community, exciting petition deliveries and wrangling local media.</p>

                <p>And who are the people behind these campaigns? CommunityRun campaigners range from unlikely heroes to seasoned activists, school kids to grandparents, farmers to investment bankers, young to old.There's no two CommunityRun campaigners a like and no mould that they fit into - they do however all share one thing in common: a passion to make things better.</p>

                    <p>Paul Toner’s petition went viral and was signed by 143,530 people in just a few days. After delivering the petition to the office of the immigration minister and multiple media hits including an influential interview with 2UE, Ali Choudhry was granted a bridging visa to appeal his migration case.</p>

                    <p>That pressure forced the Department to do what they had failed to for months: confirm a bridging visa for Ali allowing him to remain in Australia while his case is heard.

                    <p><strong>In response to the introduction of shark cull policy by the WA government, GetUp member Cara Ling started a petition calling on the government to rethink its plans.</strong></p>
                    <p>Cara’s campaign hit a nerve in the community with 9970 people signing her petition. As a NSW resident, Cara couldn’t deliver the petition to the Premier herself so emailed her supporters asking if someone could step up to do this. WA lifesaver volunteer, Andy Battle, responded and within 24 hours he had delivered the petition, attracting the attention of numerous radio stations and was featured on was featured on Perth television news on channel 7, 10 and WIN.</p>

                    <p><strong>Andy Battle’s update email to supporters:</strong> When I signed the CommunityRun petition to Save the WA Sharks a few weeks ago I had no idea that just a few days later I'd be delivering our 8,000 signatures to the Premier's office. Because all of us signed the petition - which is now well over 8,500 signatures - the delivery made headlines across the country…</p>
                    <p>I'm not an activist, but as a Surf Life Saving member and a father of four kids who love the beach, I know that protecting sharks and other marine life is critical to my kids' future.</p>

On 27 April, a 10 year health study was announced and Victoria’s Chief Health Officer received the petition from Tracie in a public ceremony in Morwell.</p>

                    <p>Thanks to the combined efforts of the community, the cork tree will now be incorporated in the new development of Coles in Norwood SA and preserved for the enjoyment and education of future generations.</p>
